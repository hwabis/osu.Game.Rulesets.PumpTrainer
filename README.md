## what is this ðŸ¤”

this is a ruleset for [osu](https://github.com/ppy/osu). it generates random but playable pump it up charts, so no spins or impossible twists. only supports single notes at a time (no holds or simultaneous notes).
this is for me to test the theory that [playing random mod](https://iidx.org/intermediate/tips#justification-for-always-using-random) helps you improve at rhythm games faster. also i get to practice to my favorite songs in osu! :)

the ruleset file is provided here: https://github.com/hwabis/pump-trainer/releases

## helpful tips if u want to try this out

- keybinds:
```
Q E R Y
 S   G
Z C V N
```
- however, i mostly play with autoplay mod on and shadow playing with my feet
- f3 and f4 in-game to change scroll speed. this is a keybind in osu! itself, not a ruleset keybind
- experiment with all the mods to generate different patterns that you want to practice
