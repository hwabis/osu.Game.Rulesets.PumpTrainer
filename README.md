### what is this ðŸ¤”

this is a ruleset for [osu](https://github.com/ppy/osu). it generates random but playable pump it up charts, so no spins or impossible twists. only supports single notes at a time (no holds or simultaneous notes).
this is for me to test the theory that [playing random mod](https://iidx.org/intermediate/tips#justification-for-always-using-random) helps you improve at rhythm games faster
